# Climate_Change_Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing global weather data to understand climate change patterns and predict future temperature trends using machine learning models.
Project Overview:
Data Source: Global weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
Objective: To develop predictive models that can forecast temperature changes over the next 10 years.
Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize relationships between weather variables.
Feature engineering to create meaningful variables such as seasonal indicators and interaction terms.
Implementation of multiple regression models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost) with hyperparameter tuning.
Ensemble learning using a Voting Regressor to improve prediction accuracy.
Visualizations to compare actual vs predicted temperatures and to display future temperature trends.
Technologies Used:
Python: For data processing and model development.
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-Learn, XGBoost: Machine learning libraries for model building and tuning.
How to Use This Repository:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries (requirements.txt provided).
